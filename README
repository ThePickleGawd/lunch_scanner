The BLE_adv_scan is a flash-based application and it will send direct
advertisements with High Duty Cycle or Low Duty Cycle based on NVDS setting,
then do scan to check if direct peer device receive the advertisement and
responds back with it's own advertisement. This example can be used with
BLE_scan_adv, WURX_adv and WURX_scan_adv examples as pair.

This example can search a group of devices with sequential addresses starting
from the peer address in the setting of direct advertisement by using
NUM_FOUND=X in make command.
e.g.
    NUM_FOUND=3, 7c:69:6b:11:11:c9 (peer addr)
    [idx] [search target address]
    [ 0 ] [  7c:69:6b:11:11:c9  ] (base_addr)
    [ 1 ] [  7c:69:6b:11:11:ca  ] (base_addr[0]+1)
    [ 2 ] [  7c:69:6b:11:11:cb  ] (base_addr[0]+2)

The default searching method searches the target address one by one. It only
switches to next address when the current target address has been found. The
default method can be changed to round robin schduling by using ROUND_ROBIN=1
in make command. It will switch to next target address on every time to search.

Please follow the examples/README "Board configuration" section for your Board
information as chip while invoking make.

===============================================================================
To build and download: (default: NUM_FOUND=1, ADV=HDC)
make BOARD=<chip> run_all

===============================================================================
Enable High Duty Cycle Direct Beacon, steps are:

1. The first direct peer device address is set
 at 06-APP_BLE_ACT_CRT_CMD/dir_hdc as following:

 # adv_param.peer_addr.
 c9 11 11 6b 69 7c	#   addr

2. To set num of peer device to search, type NUM_FOUND=X in make command.
 e.g.
    make BOARD=<chip> run_all NUM_FOUND=2

3. To search peer device one by one or Round Robin
  [one by one ] make BOARD=<chip> run_all
  [Round Robin] make BOARD=<chip> run_all ROUND_ROBIN=1

4. Select High Duty Direct Beacon setting
   make BOARD=<chip> run_all ADV=HDC

===============================================================================
Enable Low Duty Cycle Direct Beacon, steps are:

1. The first direct peer device address is set
 at 06-APP_BLE_ACT_CRT_CMD/dir_ldc as following:

 # adv_param.peer_addr.
 c9 11 11 6b 69 7c	#   addr

2. To set num of peer device to search, type NUM_FOUND=X in make command.
 e.g.
    make BOARD=<chip> run_all NUM_FOUND=2

3. To search peer device one by one or Round Robin
  [one by one ] make BOARD=<chip> run_all
  [Round Robin] make BOARD=<chip> run_all ROUND_ROBIN=1

4. Select Low Duty Direct Beacon setting
   make BOARD=<chip> run_all ADV=LDC
